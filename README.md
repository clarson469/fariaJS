# fariaJS v0.1.2
A JavaScript Utility library  

[Documentation](https://clarson469.github.io/fariaJS/)

__N.B. At the minute, fariaJS is only available in ES6. A transpiled version for use in browsers will be available soon.__  
  
__fariaJS is now a proper(ish) package! download and extract the contents to the node_modules folder in your project, and then use either `var faria = require('faria');` of `import faria from 'faria';`, depending on how your project is set up. I should stress that you do still need some kind of transpiler (i.e. babel and webpack, etc.) in your project for faria to work__


## What is fariaJS?
It's a utility library. It (I mean, to be perfectly honest here) is probably not the best one ever.  
At the minute, it serves two functions. The first is to add a bunch of small functions / methods that are standard in other languages, but aren't in JavaScript. Things like choosing a random item from an array: `random.choose()`; or string formatting: `string.format()`.  
The second is some slightly more advanced bits of array / object-literal manipulation, that are (to the best of my knowledge) not included in the big JS libraries, like lodash or underscore.  
Both of these will be added to regularly, basically as I think of them / write them.

## Why is it called fariaJS?
I like books, I like _The Count of Monte Cristo_, and the crazy priest who helps Edmond when he is jailed is called Abb√© Faria. This library is meant for helping devlopers. It makes sense...
