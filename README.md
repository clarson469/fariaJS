# fariaJS v0.1.1
A JavaScript Utility library  

[Documentation] (https://clarson469.github.io/fariaJS/)

__N.B. At the minute, fariaJS is only available in ES6. A transpiled version for use in browsers will be available soon.__  
__Again, at the minute, the library isn't an actual package. To use it as is, copy the .js file into a node.js project and use `require()` to import it, or else to use it with Webpack, change the bottom line of the file to `export default faria;` and import it as you would any other file__


## What is fariaJS?
It's a utility library. It (I mean, to be perfectly honest here) is probably not the best one ever.  
At the minute, it serves two functions. The first is to add a bunch of small functions / methods that are standard in other languages, but aren't in JavaScript. Things like choosing a random item from an array: `random.choose()`; or string formatting: `string.format()`.  
The second is some slightly more advanced bits of array / object-literal manipulation, that are (to the best of my knowledge) not included in the big JS libraries, like lodash or underscore.  
Both of these will be added to regularly, basically as I think of them / write them.

## Why is it called fariaJS?
I like books, I like _The Count of Monte Cristo_, and the crazy priest who helps Edmond when he is jailed is called Abb√© Faria. This library is meant for helping devlopers. It makes sense...
