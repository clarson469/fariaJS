# fariaJS
A JavaScript Utility library

__N.B. At the minute, fariaJS is only available in ES6. A transpiled version for use in browsers will be available soon__
__Again, at the minute, the library isn't an actual package. To use it as is, copy the .js file into a node.js project and use `require()` to import it, or else to use it with Webpack, change the bottom line of the file to `export default faria;` and import it as you would any other file__
